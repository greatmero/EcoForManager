Making decisions requires trading off one goal against another." },

The more a society spends on national defense, the less it can spend on consumer goods to raise the standard of living at home." },

These higher costs can result in lower wages, lower profits, or higher prices, thus reducing incomes." },

It refers to the size of the economic pie." },

There is often a tradeoff between these two goals." },

While water is essential, the marginal benefit of an extra cup is small because water is plentiful. By contrast, no one needs diamonds to survive, but because diamonds are so rare, people consider the marginal benefit of an extra diamond to be large." },

Because rational people make decisions by comparing costs and benefits, they respond to incentives." },

This changes their incentives, leading them to drive faster and less carefully. The result is a larger number of accidents, and while fewer drivers die per accident, there is an increase in pedestrian deaths." }

By trading with others, people can buy a greater variety of goods and services at lower cost. This applies to countries as well as families." },

This decentralized system has proven remarkably successful in organizing economic activity to promote overall economic well-being and efficiency, unlike centrally-planned economies where government officials allocate resources." },

Prices reflect both the value of a good to society and the cost to society of making the good, guiding self-interested individuals to outcomes that, in many cases, maximize the welfare of society as a whole." },

We rely on government-provided police and courts to enforce our rights over the things we produceâ€”and the invisible hand counts on our ability to enforce our rights." },

The two main causes are externalities, which are the uncompensated impacts of one person's actions on a bystander (like pollution), and market power, which is the ability of a single actor to have a substantial influence on market prices." },

Pollution is a classic example of a negative externality, where the factory does not bear the full cost of its production." }

The higher the productivity, the higher the standard of living." },

This means that, over a period of a year or two, many economic policies push inflation and unemployment in opposite directions. Reducing inflation is often associated with a temporary rise in unemployment." },
